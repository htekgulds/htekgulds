Hello, I’m Hasan! A married Muslim guy with one kid.

Currently I'm working as a DevOps Engineer using Kubernetes, Rancher, Gitlab CI and ArgoCD

I mainly write in Java and Javascript and sometimes .Net. I’m interested in NodeJs, React, Spring, Kubernetes and Devops in general.

Also, I love dragons and cats!
